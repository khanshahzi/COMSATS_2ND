# Discription
## Purpose:
This program is designed to guess the user's birthday (specifically, the day of the month from 1 to 31) by asking a series of five simple yes/no questions. 
It creates an interactive and engaging way to demonstrate basic programming concepts.
## How It Works:
- The program displays 5 different sets of numbers.
- Each set is built using binary values (1, 2, 4, 8, 16), representing individual bits in a 5-bit number.
- The user is asked whether their birthday appears in each set.
- For every "Yes" answer, the corresponding binary value is added to a total.
- After all five questions, the program sums the selected values to determine the user's birthday.
 ## Key Concepts Demonstrated:
- Use of 3D arrays to store and organize data
- Binary number system logic
- Control structures: loops (for), conditionals (if)
- Handling user input with the Scanner class
- Simple arithmetic to calculate results based on input
